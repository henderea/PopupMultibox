The Application Launcher function was added in version 2.2.0.  To use it type a <b>&gt;</b> (greater than sign) at the start of the input field.  It will then show a list of things at the root level of your start menu.  You can use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys to scroll through the results, the <b>Tab</b> key to autocomplete with the currently selected result, and <b>Enter</b> to open up the program referred to by the start menu item for the current result.  As you type, it will narrow down the listing, similar to how it works for the Filesystem Navigation function.
