This is the Visual Studio 2010 C# project (using .NET framework version 4.0) I created for the executable and installer for the Popup Multibox program.  This is a program that I am working on for fun in my free time.  If you would just like to download it, you can visit the program website at http://multibox.everydayprogramminggenius.com and click the link to the download page, which then has a link for downloading the .msi installer.  There is also a change log page, which shows all of the changes made in each version.  I did not create this repository until version 2.0.1, so it does not have version history going back to the beginning.  If you are interested in using some of my code, I would appreciate it if you could give me credit for it.  There is some code in there that I found on the internet (mostly dealing with native DLL function calls), so you obviously shouldn't give me credit if that is all you are using.  Personally, I would prefer to do the development myself (I have a specific way of doing things), but if you would like to contribute code, I will see about getting it merged into the project.  For information on what the program does and other non-code related things, you should visit the program website at the link mentioned earlier.  This is a project I am doing for fun, so at least at this point, I have no desire to make any money off of it, but if I get enough interest in it, I might add a donate button.  I hope you like the program!
