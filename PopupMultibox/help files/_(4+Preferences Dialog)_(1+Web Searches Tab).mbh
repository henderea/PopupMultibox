This is the tab that will show when you open up the dialog for the first time since starting or restarting the application, or if it was the currently selected tab when you last closed the dialog.  It is used to control the options for the [a#3.2]web search[/a] function.  The data entry works similar to Microsoft Office Excel, although it is not exactly the same.  The three columns are <b>Search Name</b>, <b>Keyword</b>, and <b>Search URL</b>.  <b>Search Name</b> is the name you want to display in the results area when you are searching for something with that search engine.  <b>Keyword</b> is the value (without spaces) that you want to type into the Multibox immediately after the <b>@</b> in order to select that search engine.  <b>Search URL</b> is the URL that the application should open to display the results page in your browser.  This application uses the same format as Google Chrome for these search engines.  That means that in the location(s) that the search query should be filled in at, you should place a <b>%s</b> (percent sign followed by the lowercase letter s).  The search terms will all be filled into the URL as one string of text, so you <u>cannot</u> have the application seperate values from the query to fill into multiple different parts of the URL (you can, however, have the <b>%s</b> placed in multiple locations to fill in the same value in all of those locations).
