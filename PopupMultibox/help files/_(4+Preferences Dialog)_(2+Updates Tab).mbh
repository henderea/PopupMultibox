The <b>Updates</b> tab gives you control over settings related to automatic update checking, a feature added in version 1.1.2.  It has an option to enable or disable the automatic checking, and if it is enabled, it lets you choose how often (in days) you want the program to check for a new version.  The default value is 1.  You will have to have the program running for it to check for updates, but if you have the program closed out for a while, it will not affect the check timer, since it is based on a stored "<i>last check</i>" value, rather than a active timer.
