In this version, I refactored my code to be cleaner and easier to maintain/update.  In doing this refactoring, I also added some additional ways in which the copy functionality could be used.  It had been originally designed specifically for the [a#3.1]Calculator[/a] function, but now it works for all of the functions.  Details on the copy functionality can be found [a#6]here[/a] (which is a page added in the 1.0.8 version).
