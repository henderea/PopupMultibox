In this version, I made some modifications to the file/folder size operation.  It now runs the operation in a background thread so that it does not freeze up the Multibox window when dealing with a large directory.  It will update the display with the current size as it calculates in order to let you know that it is still doing something.  This version also added file and folder counts to the display when getting file/folder size.  If you request the size of an individual file, it will say "1 file(s); 0 folder(s)", but because of how things are implemented, it will not hide those values when you select a file.
