To open a specific page in the [a#2.3]Help dialog[/a], start by typing a <b>?</b> (question mark).  The path is what follows the <b>?</b>.  It will show the list of items that are directly under the current path.  If the path is blank, it will show the list of items at the root level.  To scroll through the list, use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys.  To autocomplete the currently selected item, press the <b>Tab</b> key.  To open the currently selected item, press the <b>Enter</b> key.  To go back up a level, press the <b>Backspace</b> key.  All lists have an item labeled <i>&lt;Current Item&gt;</i> at the top.  This is item currently refered to by the path that has been entered in so far.  This is done so that if you autocomplete on the item you want to open, you can select the <i>&lt;Current Item&gt;</i> list item to open up the current path.  Pressing the <b>Tab</b> key on the <i>&lt;Current Item&gt;</i> list item will not do anything.
