This functionality allows you to copy the content of the text currently in the multibox entry field or of the current result.  To copy the text of the entry field, press <b>SHIFT+Enter</b> (this will also hide the multibox).  To copy the content of the current result, press <b>CTRL+Enter</b> (this will also hide the multibox).  Currently, none of the functions do anything special when you copy the entry field text, but some do have special handling for result content copying.  The behavior of the different functions when you copy the result content is displayed below.
