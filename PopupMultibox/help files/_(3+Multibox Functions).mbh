These are the functions that the Multibox application supports.  The functions that are included are ones I thought might be useful on a Windows system (which means I don't plan on adding command line support, since I am not fond of the Windows command line environment).  The majority of the functions require you to start with a specific character that defines the function.  This is so that different functions can easily be distingueshed by the program (rather than having to try to figure out what you are trying), and so that it can provide immediate feedback that is specific to the selected function (such as displaying the root level help pages as soon as you type a <b>?</b>).
