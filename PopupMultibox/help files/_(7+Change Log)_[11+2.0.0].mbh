This version is a fairly major interface change, so that is why it is 2.0.0 (rather than 1.1.5).  The functions that allow you to scroll through multiple results now also have the capability to display details on each item.  Also, the font size of the items (for multi-result mode functions like filesystem navigation, not single-result mode functions like calculator) has been decreased, so now twice the items fit in the same space.  This was done so that it would be easier to get the item text to display when the details pane is taking up half the width of the results area.  Because the items are now half the size, I have doubled the minimum and maximum values for the result height preference (4-20 instead of 2-10).  See [a#4.3]this page[/a] for information on this setting.  Also, I have changed the entry bar so that it shows the program icon at the end of the bar.  This means that the entry field is slightly shorter, although it should not be an issue for most window sizes.
