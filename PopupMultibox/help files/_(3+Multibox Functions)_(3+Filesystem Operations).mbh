To activate the Filesystem Operations function, type a <b>:</b> (colon) as the first character in the Multibox.  You can then start typing the file path, beginning with the drive you want to navigate.  Alternatively, you can begin the path with a <b>~</b> (tilde) to start navigation in your home directory.  To seperate folders, use a <b>\</b> (backslash).  Once you have entered a valid path, it will start displaying results that match what you have entered so far.  If you have not entered any characters after the <b>\</b>, it will show all files and folders in the directory, with folders listed first.  When you start typing characters after the <b>\</b>, it will start narrowing down the results to display only what matches the text you have entered.  It is <u>case-sensitive</u>!  You can use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys to scroll through the results, and can press the <b>Tab</b> key to autocomplete the path in the text entry portion of the Multibox with the item currently highlighted, or press the <b>Enter</b> key to open up the currently highlighted file or folder with the default program.  For folders, this will be Windows Explorer.  For files, this will be the program that is registered in your system's default programs listing.  If a file type does not have a default program to open it, it will display the same dialog as if you were trying to open it from Windows Explorer.
