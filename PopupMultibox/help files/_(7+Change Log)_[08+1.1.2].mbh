In this version, I added the capability to have the program automatically check for updates.  There are options in the Preferences dialog to enable/disable this feature and to change the frequency of checks.  For more information on this, see [a#4.2]this page[/a] on it.  I also made it so that when you update the application, it will automatically show this change log the first time you start the program after the update.
