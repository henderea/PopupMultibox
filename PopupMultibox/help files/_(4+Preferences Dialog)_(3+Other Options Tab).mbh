The <b>Other Options</b> tab currently only has two settings: width of the multibox (in <i>pixels</i>) and height of the results area (in maximum number of results displayed simultaneously).  The width setting will take effect as soon as you close out the Preferences dialog (which saves the preferences).  However, because of the way the results area is implemented, you must restart the application (see [a#1]this[/a] or [a#5]this[/a]) to see a change to the height setting.
