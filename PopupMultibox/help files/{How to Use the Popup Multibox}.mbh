The Popup Multibox is an application I am developing for fun in my spare time.  If you have a comment, suggestion, or bug/error report, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ehenderson@everydayprogramminggenius.com" style="color:#0000FF;pointer:cursor;">ehenderson@everydayprogramminggenius.com</a> with a subject describing what the category of the message (i.e. comment, suggestion, bug report, error report, or something else like that) is and possibly a short description of the content.  Try to give me as much information as you can (especially for bug and error reports) to help me fix/add the functionality.  I hope you like this program!
