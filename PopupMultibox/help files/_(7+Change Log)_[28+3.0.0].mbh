In this version, I rewrote the structure of the code so that the functions are now seperated out into plugins as separate DLL libraries.  As part of this, I now have a Plugin Updater, which requires admin privileges in order to be able to update the plugins.  This means that when the Plugin Updater is started, it will (on Vista and 7) ask you if you want to let the program run.  The reason it requires these elevated execution privileges is because otherwise it would not be able to download the plugin updates into the applications Program Files folder.  The benefit of having the functions in separate plugins is that now you won't have to download a whole new installer with all of the functions, and can instead just close out the main Multibox program (something you have to do if you are going to open the Plugin Updater, and something that is done when you open the Plugin Updater from the button in the Version Check dialog), open the Plugin Updater (and press "Yes" on Vista and 7), select the updates you want to install (there are check all and uncheck all buttons), and click install.  After it installs, it will update the list.  At any time (other than when you are installing), you can click the button at the end of the row of buttons (after the progress bar) to close out the plugin updater and open up the main Multibox program.  Hopefully this new way of doing things will be a good improvement!
