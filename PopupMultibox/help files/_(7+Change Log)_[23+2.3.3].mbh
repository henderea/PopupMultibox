In this version, I added some small functionality to the filesystem functionality.  Now, when you type the <b>:</b> to start using the function, it will display the list of drives on your computer (e.g. C:\, D:\, etc.) in the same manner as it displays folders and files.  Also, when you type <b>CTRL</b>+<b>Backspace</b>, the path will remove the text after the last \ (or the second-to-last, if the last character in the path is already a \), rather than add that strange character.
