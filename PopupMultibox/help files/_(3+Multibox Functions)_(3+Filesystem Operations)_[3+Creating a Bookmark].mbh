To bookmark a filesystem location, type a <b>&lt;&lt;</b> (two less than signs) at the end of a path (when in regular navigation mode), followed by the name of the bookmark (no spaces in between the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and the bookmark name).  Once you have entered in the bookmark name, press the <b>Enter</b> key to save the bookmark.
