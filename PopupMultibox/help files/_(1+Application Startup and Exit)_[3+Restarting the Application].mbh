If you need to close and immediately re-open the Multibox application, you can press <b>CTRL+R</b> when the Multibox is the active window, or you can right-click the [a#5]task bar icon[/a] and click the Restart item.  This can be useful if you have changed a setting that requires an application restart to take effect.
