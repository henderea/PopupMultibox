In this version, I did a slight fix to the details display for the help launch function (I forgot to replace an empty string with a --), as well as a change to the filesystem navigation function details display that makes it so that it will display the file type in the same way as Windows Explorer (such as "Microsoft Excel Document").  Other than that, I have not changed anything for this version.
