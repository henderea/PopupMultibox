In this version, I did some more refactoring of the code to spread out the code between files so there are not a few files that are really long.  I also took out some unnecessary code in order to reduce the total code in the files.  Nothing else was done.  I believe I have tested everything, but if there is something that doesn't work, let me know at <a href="mailto:ehenderson@everydayprogramminggenius.com" style="color:#0000FF;pointer:cursor;">ehenderson@everydayprogramminggenius.com</a>.
