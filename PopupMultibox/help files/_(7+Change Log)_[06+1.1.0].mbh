In this version, I added the capability to get the size of a directory in the same way as was implemented for files in the previous version.  I also made it so that you can specify the unit that is used to display the size.  To make this work with directories, I also implemented a 5-minute cache of the file size for the most recent path, so that it doesn't re-calculate the size every time you press a key.  You can find more about this [a#3.3]here[/a].
