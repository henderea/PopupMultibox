This is the Visual Studio 2010 **C#** project (using .NET framework version **4.0**) I created for the executable and installer for the Popup Multibox program.  This is a program that I am working on for fun in my free time.  If you would just like to download it, you can visit the program website at [http://multibox.everydayprogramminggenius.com](http://multibox.everydayprogramminggenius.com) and click the link to the download page, which then has a link for downloading the .msi installer.  There is also a change log page, which shows all of the changes made in each version.  I did not create this repository until version 2.0.1, so it does not have version history going back to the beginning.  If you are interested in using some of my code, I would appreciate it if you could give me credit for it.  There is some code in there that I found on the internet (mostly dealing with native DLL function calls), so you obviously shouldn't give me credit if that is all you are using.  For information on what the program does and other non-code related things, you should visit the program website at the link mentioned earlier.
