When the path in the multibox entry field is a file, you can type <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> (three greater than signs) to display the size of the file.  It will convert it to the proper ending (using 1024 as the number of bytes in a kilobyte), and display the number, with the ending, rounded to three decimal places (or less if there are not three).  It also supports this feature for use with directories, and as of version 1.1.3, the program will no longer freeze up when you try to get the size of a large directory.  It now runs the file/directory size operation in a background thread and updates the display as it calculates.  Version 1.1.3 also added file and folder counts to the display.  It will cache the size of the last path that was checked, and will reset the cache after 5 minutes, or if you check the size of a different path.  You can also force the cache to be reset by pressing the <b>Tab</b> key.  If it is calculating when you press <b>Tab</b>, it will restart the calculation.  Caching is done so that if you are changing the unit of the displayed value (mentioned next), it will not have to recalculate the size every time you press a key.  To specify the unit to use, type the unit (case-insensitive) immediately after the <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> (no spaces in between).  The units supported are <i>B</i>, <i>KB</i>, <i>MB</i>, <i>GB</i>, and <i>TB</i>.
