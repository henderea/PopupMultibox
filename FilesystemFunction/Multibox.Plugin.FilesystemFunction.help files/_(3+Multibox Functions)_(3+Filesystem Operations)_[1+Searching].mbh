If the current path in the Multibox entry field is a folder, you can type <b>&gt;&gt;</b> (two greater-than signs) followed by a space to start searching for files located inside that folder or any subfolder of that folder.  By default, it will try to match your search term anywhere in the filename (which includes the extension), but if you start the search query with a <b>/</b> (forward slash), it will match the pattern against the entire filename.  You can use the wildcard character <b>*</b> (astrisk) to match 0 or more characters, and the wildcard character <b>?</b> (question mark) to match 0 or 1 characters.  As with the regular filesystem navigation, you can use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys to scroll through the results and the <b>Enter</b> key to open the currently highlighted result.  Pressing the <b>Tab</b> key when searching will autocomplete with that result, switching back from the search to regular navigation.
