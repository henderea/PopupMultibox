To access a filesystem bookmark you have already created, type <b>&gt;&gt;</b> (two greater than signs) as the start of the text in the entry field.  This will bring up a list of bookmarks.  As you start typing more characters, it will narrow down the list to only the ones that start with what you have typed so far.  To go to a bookmark, press the <b>Tab</b> key (not <b>Enter</b>, since that would close the multibox window), and it will switch to filesystem navigation mode with the location stored in the bookmark already filled in.  To delete a bookmark, select the bookmark in the results and press <b>SHIFT+DEL</b>.  If you want the bookmark back, you will have to recreate it.
